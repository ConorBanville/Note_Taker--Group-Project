#### Introduction

This is just a brief document to describe how to get started with this project, it will evolve over time as we progress through the project and will eventually encompass our work for the module.

#### Install Instructions

#### Important Notes

- Should you have any difficulties or questions with tasks during the sprint or need clarification, feel free to contact me on my student email or in our Teams Group, email tends to reach me quicker so this is best.

- Step 2 of "Firebase Login for Angular & Enable Auth" has been already done as to make it simpler to work with, so the following command: `npm install @angular/fire firebase --save` has already been run and does not need to be executed again.

- This step just installed needed libraries for Firebase and our app to work together, and since we are new to Angular its best we don't look at this just yet.

- You will also find that there are four folders inside of the app directory. Each of these is one section of our website. You may copy and paste the code you've wrote into these components.

#### Resources

- Should you need to download the most recent changes from the repository using the "GitHub Desktop" software, I believe the solution to be clicking the "repository" button at the top and clicking on the "pull" button to get the changes onto your machine. Should this not work for you, please let me know.

- [Beginners Guide to Angular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TLhUCjY9iA) via Youtube. This will help you understand how Angular works and how its folders are structured.

- [GitHub Pull Requests & Forking by TheCodingTrain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NrSWLQsDL4) via Youtube. This will tell you how to add your changes to the project.

- [Setting Up Firebase](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/firebase-angular-application-with-auth-and-realtime-database-ae37fef5859d/) (Only first few setup parts) via FreeCodeCamp. Helps to setup our database for later.

- [Firebase Login for Angular & Enable Auth](https://fireship.io/lessons/angularfire-google-oauth/) via Fireship. Runs through how to enable authentication and how to implement it.

- [Github Desktop Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77W2JSL7-r8) via Youtube. Tells you how to use the "GitHub Desktop" application for this project.

- [Making Tic-Tac-Toe in Angular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0bBLvWXBvc) via Youtube. This is a great introduction to how we make projects in Angular.

- [Angular in 100 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ata9cSC2WpM) via Youtube. Introduces you to Angular in a very general manner.

- [What's an Angular Component?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23o0evRtrFI) via Youtube. Explains what the components you are working in really are.

#### General Channels

- Should you find yourself needing to learn a new skill, I would recommend the following channels to learn from.

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) via Youtube.

#### References

Throughout our project as we begin prototyping features, we may use code found on guides online, these will be referenced accordingly.

- [Firebase Auth Services](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/firebase-authentication-with-angular.html) was used to help implement authentication logic.
- [CRUD Services with Firebase](https://blog.logrocket.com/creating-a-crud-firebase-documents-in-angular/) was used to connect frontend to notes.
